## Thanks for stopping by

This site is the online home of Phil Hawksworth, and Phil doesn't love talking about himself in the third person, so he's going to stop that now if you don't mind.

## About me

I have been building things on the web professoinally for almost 20 years. Between 2009 and 2018 that happened at agencies where I was fortunate to work with a wide range of public and private sector clients.

<!--
After 9 years working at agencies, I returned to working on a product. Now as part of the Developer Relations team at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) my focus is on developing strategies for using [JAMstack](https://www.jamstack.org) technologies to make building for the web simpler, faster and more secure. -->


## Home in the world

I live in the leafy English city of [St Albans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans), just a few miles north of London with my wife and our 2 naughty cats.
