title: Appealing for better resumes
description: |
    Getting your resume right is tricky. Here is what I look for when I'm trying to find the right web developer in a stack of paper.
excerpt: |
    There was a time when my experience of CVs or resumes was limited to my own two pages of acheivements, buzzwords, qualifications and attempts to look like a valuable employee.  These days I recieve a lot of resumes to review, and usually with less time than I would like to make an assessment of them.  There are a few things that I look for in particular during my hunt for a web developer to work as a freelancer or as a permanent addition to our team.

<p>
    Back when I was at school an compiling my first resume, I was always told that I should keep it to a single page. Two pages at the most.  Even then that was a challenge since I would begin by listing <i>every single thing I could remember ever achieving</i> without any kind of quality control.
</p>
<p>
    The truth is that this is advice that I wish more people would follow. I've discovered that I almost never read a resume from start to finish. (It's true. I confess it), but rather I skim it looking first for some key attributes.  I've found that if I'm faced with a single page, I will read the entire thing, but as soon as it gets much beyond that, I'm back into skimming and dipping mode. Bad form? Perhaps. But I'm not alone. Long multipage resumes are met with sagging shoulders as if I was asked to ready and assess a novel between meetings.

<h2>Must have</h2>
<p>Primarily, I'm on the search for web developers of one flavour or another and so there are some things that I seek out as immediately each time. They are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>A URL.</b> It is surprising how often people looking to work on the web don't demonstrate that they are engaged with and passionate about it.  I would always expect a web professional to have a footprint on the web. It might me a blog, a portfolio site, or even just a tumblr log or similar. Participation in the medium seems like an abvious prerequisite</li>
    <li>
        <b>A github account.</b> Demonstrating active particiaption in development projects has never been easie tahanks to the like os bitbucket and github.  Good web developers tend to find and participate with projects on github and it has become a great way to see what technologies people are interested in, or even better, contributing to. It can also demonstrate an understanding of one or tow development tool fundamentals
    </li>
</ul>
