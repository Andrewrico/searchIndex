description: Clarifying my opinion on the recent Google and Codeclub non-scandal scandal
---

<div class="grab">
  Following the storm of opinions, name calling, and half-baked theories on twitter about Linda leaving the Code Club board, I ventured an opinion of my own about some of the hperbole being thrown around. I did so in a tweet, which is rarely the best way to make an unambiguous point. I feel the need to clarify.

  After reading one particular article about this, I felt compelled to tweet towards Aral Balkan, who was quoted in the piece. It was not my finest moment. <a href="https://twitter.com/philhawksworth/status/505017839242080256" title="">I asked</a> (somewhat passive aggressively):
</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div>
    <a href="http://twitter.com/aral">@aral</a> Curious - did Google make their donation conditional that nobody voice any [negative] opinion, or was the <a href="http://twitter.com/codeclub">@CodeClub</a> board being cautious?
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This was a bit silly. It didn't convey they point I wanted to make well for anyone who was not close to the conversation thus far. My intention was to give Aral an opportunity to debunk the allegations that Google dictated terms and censorship over Code Club by investing in them. (Which they did not)
</p>
<p>
  I got <a href="https://twitter.com/aral/status/505048116564094976">this response</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <div><a href="http://twitter.com/philhawksworth">@philhawksworth</a> I don’t know whether or not Google said anything but I would assume they didn’t (which makes it worse, in my view).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
  
</p>




<p>
  I must be clear - <b>I have no inside knowledge of the events leading to Linda's resignation from the board of Code Club</b>, but I found it hard to imagine that any of the Code Club contributors would dictate such terms when investing, and since then, Google have gone on to make a formal statment to that effect.  
</p>
<p>
  Internal Code Club politics aside, I'm more concerned for the moment with addressing something else: the tendancy to throw inflamatory soundbites around without supporting evidence.
</p>
<p>
  I'm reluctant to add another link to this "news article", but I need to substantiate that I'm not making these quotes up. <a href="http://pando.com/2014/08/27/code-club-cofounder-resigns-after-being-ordered-not-to-criticize-google/">David Holmes</a> asks:

    What other strings have they attached to the program? Will every teacher and student have to sign up for the programming training through Google Plus?</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div>Would Google make an intellectual property claim on all the lines of code written by these kids?</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope. Don't be silly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div>How about inserting a nice Cold War era-style “You and the NSA” propaganda video into the syllabus, to help children learn early on that privacy is a joke?</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope. Go to bed.</p>
