excerpt: |
    Dynamic and engaging content is something that most websites strive for in order to keep an audience engaged and to communucate effectively. Sites that have regularly changing content or news updates need a way to manage this and over the years content management systems have become more affordable and commonplace. Such tools can be a huge enabler and allow for content publishing of content by non-developers. But how good are these really? Where do they go wrong and how can they hurt us rather than help us?

When it omes to CMS, my most common gripe of late has been that some claim not to "support mobile".  It's hard to know where to begin in responding to that disclaimer.  In this world of "responsive design" and "mobile first" (yes, I'm fully buzzword compliant here!) web developers have learned that websites we build are viewed in web browsers, and those browsers are increasingly on mobile devices. They are part of the web, not an extra line-item on an invoice for websote generation.
