title: Talking at JSDay in Verona
description: Looking forward to speaking at JSDay in Verona
excerpt: |
    In a few days I'll be speaking at <a href="http://2013.jsday.it/" title="JS Day, Verona, 2013">JSDay</a> in Verona. I'm lucky enough to have another chance to present a version of my Excessive Enhancement talk which I first gave in Brighton way back in November 2011.  But isn't it out of date?

<p>
    Well, I don't think so. The message that I'm trying to convey in this talk is, sadly, still as pertinent as ever.  I'll be updating it to keep it current, with new examples and case studies, but the trends that I'm hoping to encourage people to think about remains the same.
</p>
<p>
    Here's the synopsis:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        We all love to see exciting and innovative "interface shizzle" driven by JavaScript and the ever increasing rendering capabilities of modern browsers, but are we getting these at the expense of the Web?
    </p>
    <p>
        This talk will explore the good, the bad, and the fugly of rich interfaces, while examining how and why we should take care not to damage the Web.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    My main message is that of care and consideration for users and for the Web.
</p>
<p>
    In the last year, the average page weight has grown 24%, according to the <a href="http://httparchive.org">HTTP Archive</a>, and this includes a growth in the amount of JavaScript which is delivered for interpreting in the browser.
</p>
<p>
   In itself, that's not the end of the world, but there are a few examples of fashionable web site designs (often popular with big brands who employ agencies) which might suggest that this slope will get steeper if their practices and tastes are emulated and become popular.
</p>
<p>
    This talk reflects on that while trying not to burst everyone's bubble. Let's see how we get on.
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there were still tickets available.</p>
