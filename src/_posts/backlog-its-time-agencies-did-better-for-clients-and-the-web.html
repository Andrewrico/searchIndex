excerpt: |
    As someone who works in a bustling creative agency on a wide variety of clients, and on a wide variety of projects, I have started to observe to some problematic and recurring patterns.  Many are an inevetable result of the way that the agency model has evolved, and two of these stand out as things that matter deeply to me as a developer and participant on the Web. Both of these impact quality of agency output and potentially the health of the web.
