        <h3>The plan</h3>
        <p>
          My plan is to give a talk which:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gives detail, by looking into the structure of the hypertext link inlcuding some aspects that some might not know;</li>
          <li>Is entertaining, by including stories from the history of the Web and the Link;</li>
          <li>Gives background and context, and is a thought provoking call to arms for people who care about the Web.</li>
      </ul>
        <h3>Links and supporting material</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Links for other conferences I have spoken at available on my <a href="/speaking">Speaking</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>More coverage and conferece details available via my <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/philhawksworth/" rel="me">Lanyrd</a> profile</li>
