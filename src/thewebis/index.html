        <h3>The plan</h3>
        <p>
          My plan is to give a talk which:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gives detail, by looking into the structure of the hypertext link inlcuding some aspects that some might not know;</li>
          <li>Is entertaining, by including stories from the history of the Web and the Link;</li>
          <li>Gives background and context, and is a thought provoking call to arms for people who care about the Web.</li>
      </ul>
        <h3>Links and supporting material</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Links for other conferences I have spoken at available on my <a href="/speaking">Speaking</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>More coverage and conferece details available via my <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/philhawksworth/" rel="me">Lanyrd</a> profile</li>
        <li>Slides from other events on my <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/philhawksworth" rel="me">Speakerdeck</a> page.</li>
</ul>
        <h3>Bragging</h3>
        <p>
          A couple of comments on my talks which made my head swell:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
        I Can Smell Your CMS by @philhawksworth. One of the best talks I've ever seen, and I'm hearing it live at #bdconf
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>
Phil seems to be a clone of Jake Archibald who went to design school. Very funny, very quick, with beautiful slides and examples and tales from the trenches he knows how to engage and to give out good info to boot. To me one of the best talks Iâ€™ve seen lately.
