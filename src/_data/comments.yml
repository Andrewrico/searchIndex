    comment: "The main problem with external comment providers is that I&#39;d have to submit user data to strangers. \r\n\r\nAny chance to make this self-hosted like Isso and Discourse? The one thing lacking to make the switch from WordPress for me. "

    comment: "&gt;“Exactly!&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;So once you do know what the question actually is, you&#39;ll know what the answer means.” \r\n&gt;— The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy\r\n\r\nTotally great! Besides for commenting this just gave a brilliant boost to an idea I am having with (somewhat) front-end form submission of content... would love to chat. Might be something to further build upon."

    comment: "Thanks Jon!\r\n\r\nThat was one of the main reasons for making Poole. I&#39;d rather not have to load in my comments with JavaScript for a service like Disqus.\r\n\r\nI hope it proves useful for you. If you find yourself wanting it to do something it doesn;t yet, feel free to make suggestions on the [roadmap trello board](https://trello.com/b/lyQEqQMq/poole)"
