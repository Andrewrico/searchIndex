      comment: "Thanks Justin.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m interested in hearing how people get on with using Poole for things like comments systems on their blogs. Do let me know if you have questions or suggestions for the [feature roadmap](https://trello.com/b/lyQEqQMq/poole).\r\n\r\n"

      comment: "Thanks Jon!\r\n\r\nThat was one of the main reasons for making Poole. I&#39;d rather not have to load in my comments with JavaScript for a service like Disqus.\r\n\r\nI hope it proves useful for you. If you find yourself wanting it to do something it doesn;t yet, feel free to make suggestions on the [roadmap trello board](https://trello.com/b/lyQEqQMq/poole)"
