    You can usually find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/philhawksworth">Twitter</a>. And you can sometimes find me at web development <a href="/speaking">conferences</a>, where I might be talking about development techniques. I blog here less frequently than I'd like, but manage it a little more often on the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog">Netlify blog</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wherever you find me, online or in the real world, please do come and say a friendly hello.
