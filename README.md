Phil Hawksworth's blog.  Served up at [https://hawksworx.com]() and hosted on [http://www.netlify.com](Netlify)


## Overview

This simple blog comprises of static files generated by Jekyll for easy deployment and hosting. It uses Gulp to automate some build optimisation tasks to improve performance.


## Environment installation

To build the site you need:

- Jekyll
- Node
- Gulp


To setup the build environment, clone the repository and then in the working directory run: `npm install` to install any node modules required by grunt.

The site can then be built and served via Gulp:

`gulp serve`


## Deployment

Deployment is triggered by a push to the master branch of the repo on Github. Netlify monitors this branch and initiates a build and deplyment within Netlify automatically.


Build and optimise the deployable site, and serve that up on [http://localhost:8000]() : `gulp`
