Phil Hawksworth's blog.  Served up at [http://hawksworx.com]() and hosted on Github Pages.


## Overview

This simple blog comprises of static files generated by Jekyll for easy deployment and hosting. It uses Gulp to automate some build optimisation tasks to improve performance.


## Environment installation

To build the site you need:

- Jekyll
- Node
- Gulp


To setup the build environment, clone the repository and then in the working directory run: `npm install` to install any node modules required by grunt.

The site can then be built and served via Jekyll:

`jekyll serve -w`


## Deployment

Deployment is via a git push to GitHub Pages and is automated via Gulp:


Build and optimise the deployable site, and serve that up on [http://localhost:8000]() : `gulp`

Deploy the site to gh-pages: `gulp deploy`
