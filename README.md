Phil Hawksworth's blog.  Served up at http://hawksworx.com and hosted on Github Pages.


## Overview

This simple blog comproses of static files generated by Jekyll for easy deployment and hosting. It uses Grunt to automte some build optimisation tasks to improve performance.


## Environment installation

To build the site you need:

- Jekyll
- Node
- Grunt

To setup the build environment, clone the repository and then in the working directory run: `npm install` to intsall any node modules required by grunt.

The site can then be built via grunt:

`grunt dev` or `grunt prod`

Each will produce a deployable `_site` directory with the prod target performing some minification etc.  You can serve the produced site locally by running `grunt serve`


## Deployment

Deployment is via a git push to Git Hub pages and is automated via Fabric:

`fab deloy`
