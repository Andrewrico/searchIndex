## How can I help?

Got questions? I might have answers. You can but ask!

You can always [ask me things on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/philhawksworth) but if that's not your thing don't worry, you can ask me questions directly through this site.

I'll do my best to respond, just as long as you ask nicely ;)

## What?

- [Ask me questions about speaking.](to-speak)
- [Ask me questions about, well... anything else.](anything)
